Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the developmet and maintenance of high qualit softwares.
Software engineering is rucial in the technology industry for it enables the cretion of softwre applications and systems to power various aspects of our daily lives.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Programming Languages - Are a system of notation for writing computer progrms and they include python, javascript, C+
Rise of agile methodologies - emphasizes on the collaboration, flexibility and customer satisaction
Structured programming - it is a paradigm focused at improving the quality, clarity and development time of a computer program

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documentation of system requirements and user needs
Design - Creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Testing - Conducting tests to ensure quality standards and functionality is met
Deployment - Realising the software to the users
MAintenance - provision of updates, support and software enhancements after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is more focused on a sequential approach going through distinctive phases while thw agile methodology employs iterative and incremental approach focused on collaboration andflexibility

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -resposible for writing code and implemetation of software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing plans
Project Manager - Ovesees the planning, execution and deployment of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development enviroments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code.(e.g Pycharm, Microsoft Visual Code)
Version Control Systems are tools for tracking changes to  source codes and corrdinate projects among team members(e.g Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges iclude: changing requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt and to vercone these challenges, software engineers need to employ the following strategies: effective communication, agile methodologies, regular assessment of project goals,timelines and prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individua components and modules of a software
Itegration testing - Test interactions between different subsystems
System testing - testing the software as a whole
Acceptance testing - Testing software against user requiremets and checking if the user needs are met
The importance of testing in quality control is thet it helps in identifying defects ealy and gives room for resolving them in the early development process leading to a quality software product

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an insruction that can be understood and interpreted by an AI model.
Promt engineering ensures that AI models produce relevant and accurate outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Instead of saying"the maumau war",you can say," tell me about the leading fighters of maumau"
Improved prompt is effective for it imroves the interaction between human and AI while  esuring AI models give accurte and relevant outputs
